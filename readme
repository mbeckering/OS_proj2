Use: ./master -n <1 to 18>

./parse.bash <logname.log>

The bash script: I'm confused as to how exactly this should work but I'm out 
of time for questions. Enter the log name and it gives some totals and 
averages as asked. If it's going to hurt my grade, I'll do more and turn 
in later if possible, please specify what it should do.

I lowered the producer sleep time (to 1-3 seconds) to make use of more 
consumers as the instructor mentioned in class.

I chose 18 max consumers (master + producer + 18 = 20). I later realized that 
bash makes it 21 processes, but it still seems to work, so I didn't change it.

I (embarrassingly) count about 45 hours of work on this project. Every element 
was new to me and took hours of research and troubleshooting and help from the 
instructor (THANK YOU).

Could have improved: More functions to re-use code, add flexibility (i.e. # of 
buffers), reduce lines, and neaten everything up. I found out I could have 
passed shared memory info instead of shmgetting it all in each executable. I 
could have combined some of the shared info into structs, but I have 
practically no experience with structs. I decided to first make everything 
work any way I knew how. There is a lot I want to go back and improve. But it 
works, it meets the criteria, and frankly I'm out of time to spend. I learned 
a lot but it was a much, much larger time investment than I expected.
