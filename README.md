# OS_proj2

I (embarrassingly) count about 45 hours of work on this project (haven't started the bash script yet). Every element was new to me and took hours of research and troubleshooting, not to mention help from the instructor (THANK YOU). I'm probably at a disadvantage because 1) Too many prereqs with Schulte 2) I only take night classes, 2 per semester, work full time. So some of my prereqs are years back now and I have to re-learn too much (looking at you, pointers and arrays).

I certainly could have created more functions to re-use code, reduce lines, and neaten everything up. I believe I could have passed shared memory info instea of grabbing it all in each executable. I certainly could have combined some of the info into structs, but I have practically no experience with structs and decided to try to make it work any way I knew how. There is a lot I want to improve, but it works, it meets the criteria, and I truly can't afford to spend any more time on this project.
